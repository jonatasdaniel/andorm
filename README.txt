AndOrm - Android Persistence Framework

AndOrm is an object-relational mapping framework targeted towards Android development. It encapsulates the lower level SQLite API and offers an higher-level, object-oriented interface, rendering the work to create SQL statements and handling the native Android persistence resources transparent to the developer.
